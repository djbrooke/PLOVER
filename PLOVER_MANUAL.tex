\chapter{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}

During the twentieth century, two coding frameworks dominated event data research: Charles McClelland's WEIS \citep{McClelland67,McClelland76}  and the Conflict and Peace Data Bank (COPDAB) developed by Edward Azar \citep{AzarSloan75, Azar80, Azar82}. Both were created during the Cold War and assumed a ``Westphalian-Clausewitzian'' political world in which sovereign states reacted to each other primarily through official diplomacy
and military threats. While innovative when first created, these coding systems were less than optimal for dealing with contemporary issues such as ethnic conflict, low-intensity violence, organized criminal activity, and multilateral intervention. Furthermore, \citet[pg. 177]{McClelland83} viewed WEIS as only a ``first phase''; he certainly did not anticipate that it would continue to be used, with only minor modifications, for four decades. Event coding ontologies, it seems, tend to be rather sticky.

During the early 2000s, the CAMEO framework---Conflict and Mediation Event Observations---was developed,\footnote{The canonical citation for CAMEO is \cite{SGY09}, and the most recent version of the manual is found at \texttt{http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/data.dir/cameo.html}.  The original event framework was very much the work of Deborah Gerner and \"Om\"ur Yilmaz, with contributions by various coders in the Kansas Event Data System project. The CAMEO manual contains an extended discussion of the issues considered in transitioning from WEIS to CAMEO. Additional details on the development of the automated coding underlying CAMEO can be found in \cite{Schrodt06TPM} or \texttt{http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/utilities.dir/KEDS.History.0611.pdf}. } and originally was intended merely to support an NSF-funded project on the study of inter-state conflict mediation. Instead, it was gradually adopted as a ``next generation'' coding scheme, notably for the DARPA-funded Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS) project \citep{OBrien10} because it corrected some of the long-recognized ambiguities in WEIS and COPDAB, and was explicitly designed both for automated coding and for the detailed coding of sub-state actors. 

As event data came into wider use in the 2010s, several problems with the CAMEO standard---which had never been intended to be a ``standard'' in the first place---became apparent. These included

\begin{itemize}
\item Almost all applications of CAMEO event data aggregated to either the 2-digit ``cue category'' or the even more general ``quad category.''\fn{Verbal cooperation, material cooperation, verbal conflict, and material conflict, with these usually defined exclusively using the 2-digit categories.} No one used all 260 codes.
\item Nonetheless, users unfamiliar with the data generating process for automated event coding sometimes assumed every code had been equally well implemented.
\item The complexity of CAMEO made it almost impossible to generate a comprehensive set of ``gold standard records'' and human coders had difficulty agreeing on how to consistently distinguish many of the subcategories: this became particularly apparent as efforts were made to implement CAMEO in Spanish and Arabic.
\item Newer coding systems provided information such as geolocation and named-entity extraction beyond the original date-source-target-event format and there was no standard for how to include these in the data.
\item The continuing emphasis on coding substate activities demonstrated the need for either new categories or contexts to deal, for example, with criminal activity and events such as natural disaster, elections, and parliamentary behavior.
\end{itemize}

Predictably, because of these and other issues, by 2015 CAMEO was beginning to ``fork'': both the ICEWS data implementation of CAMEO in the BBN/Raytheon \txt{ACCENT} coder \\ (\url{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/icews}) and the implementation in the Caerus Analytics/Open Event Data Alliance (OEDA) \txt{PETRARCH-2} coder (\url{https://github.com/openeventdata/petrarch2}) differed significantly in some of the CAMEO categories compared to the original implementation in the University of Kansas \txt{TABARI} coder. 

To address these concerns, an informal group of academic, government and private sector producers and users of event data met and circulated drafts during the fall of 2016 to develop a new, simplified and more flexible event data specification to replace CAMEO: the end product of those deliberations is the document you are reading. The major changes are the following

\begin{itemize}
\item A set of standardized names (``fields'') for JSON (\url{http://www.json.org/}) records are specified for both the core event data fields and for extended information such as geolocation and extracted texts; most of these fields are optional and where available we use existing specifications, for example the \url{http://geonames.org} geographical location field names, ISO-3166 country identifiers and ISO-8601 date and time formats.
\item Only the 2-digit event ``cue categories'' have been retained from CAMEO: our hope is that these are sufficiently broad and distinct that one can achieve a reasonably high level of human inter-coder agreement---hence ``verifiable''---on the coding categories, and that these distinctions can be consistently implemented, across all categories, in the automated system. These are defined in greater detail than they were in WEIS and CAMEO.
\item The CAMEO 01 and 02 categories dealing with comments have been eliminated.\fn{Ironically, this reverses a decision McClelland belatedly made---and later regretted---in the WEIS specification in the 1960s.}
\item The CAMEO 08 ``YIELD'' category has been split into verbal (\plcat{CONCEDE}) and material (\plcat{RETREAT}) components. 
\item \sout{A new category has been added for criminal behavior.}
\item Much of the detail 3- and 4-digit details is now delegated to an optional \texttt{mode} field : see Section \ref{ssec:ecm} for further discussion of this.  
\item The ``target actor" event component was renamed ``recipient" for clarity and to better match the terminology used in the NLP literature on event extraction \citep{halterman2020extracting}.
\item A ``context'' field is available, along with standard values, to handle contexts such as disease, natural disaster, elections, parliamentary processes and cyber-security.\fn{In contrast to the Integrated Data for Events Analysis (IDEA) \cite{BBOJT03} system which was in use in the early 2000s, we are not treating disease and disaster as events with recipients, instead they are a context within which other activity occurs. This, interestingly, echoes an approach used in COPDAB but not retained by WEIS and CAMEO.}
\item The complexity of substate actor codes has been limited, and the allowable substate modifiers have been substantially simplified. 
\item Standard optional fields have been defined for some categories, and the ``recipient'' is optional in some categories.
\item We have converted all of the examples in the CAMEO manual to an initial set of English-language ``gold standard records'' for validation purposes---these files can be found at\\ \url{https://github.com/openeventdata/PLOVER/blob/master/PLOVER_GSR_CAMEO.txt}---and we expect to both expand this corpus and extend it to  at least Spanish and Arabic cases. This documentation includes the English-language gold standard records from the CAMEO manual.
\end{itemize}

Because PLOVER is generally a simplification of CAMEO\sout{---the new \textsf{CRIME} category is the one exception---}our expectation is that it will be relatively easy to transition the existing CAMEO-based coders into this by simply collapsing the two- and three-digit categories; a similar simple recoding will allow older CAMEO-coded data sets to be converted to their PLOVER equivalents. The standardization of the JSON field names---as well as adoption of JSON as the data interchange format---will allow the development of general-purpose utilities that can work with all formats, in contrast with the current proliferation of incompatible CSV and tab-delimited formats.

\section{Issues we will not be addressing}\label{sec:nothing}

In the discussions leading to the development of PLOVER, several additional open issues were raised that we have decided to remain agnostic on:

\begin{description}
\item[Temporal markup:] This is emerging as a major issue, particular among users who are interested in the long-standing objective of automated chronology generators. While there are some significant efforts on this in the NLP community---\url{http://www.timeml.org/}---we don't feel we currently have the experience required to make recommendations.
\item[Number of events per sentence:] Everyone in the community now has a collection of sentences that could be interpreted as containing anywhere from one to a half-dozen or more events. While this is nominally an ontological issue---``the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being''---the ability to resolve it will be highly dependent on specific parser/coder implementations, so we're leaving it at that level. Same for sentence-level vs paragraph- or article-level coding.
\item[De-duplication:] There is no consensus on this beyond noting that the widely-used ``one-a-day filtering'' is probably not a good idea,\fn{See \texttt{http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/papers.dir/Schrodt.TAD-NYU.EventData.pdf}} and it is a topic where there is currently active research and experimentation, so we're leaving it alone.
\end{description}

As a more general caveat, we would very much encourage anyone who is using a PLOVER-coded data set to look carefully at the software used to implement it, particularly with regard to
\begin{itemize}
\item The motivations (and resources available) for producing the data, which will often provide information on how much attention was given to various categories. 
\item If the coder is dictionary-based, the event and actor dictionaries if these are available. If the coder is classifier-based, the training cases if these are available.
\item Recall/precision tradeoffs and how these play out across different news sources: we are not aware of any existing parser/coder that is optimal for everything from a Reuters story written and edited by people trained at Oxford to a BBC radio transcript from a static-filled French radio report out of Goma, DRC quickly translated into English by a non-native speaker of either language.
\item We strongly encourage data sets to include references (URLs or other unique identifiers) for texts which are in a corpus used as the source of the texts but were \textit{not} coded, whether because the information was found to be irrelevant in pre-filtering, the texts was considered a duplicate, no event was found in the text, or other reasons: this will enable systems to be compared on the basis of recall, where we currently have very little information. 
\end{itemize}

OEDA was founded on the principle that there should not be ``one data set to rule them all'': different implementations will have different strengths. PLOVER is at least as much a data-interchange format as a coding ontology, and should simplify the ability of the research to check the robustness of results by looking at multiple independent coding efforts. Do it!



\section{Why ``PLOVER''?}

Plovers (\textit{Charadriidae}) are a globally-distributed family of short-billed gregarious wading birds who spend their lives frantically poking through endless stretches of sand and muck trying to find something of interest. It is difficult to imagine a better analogy to the process of coding event data.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Event Categories}



\section{Event, Mode, and Context}\label{ssec:ecm}

As noted above, most\fn{``most'' because some of the details coded in CAMEO, particularly those dealing specifically with mediation, have been eliminated.} of the detail found in the 3- and 4-digit categories of CAMEO is now found in the \texttt{mode} and  \texttt{context} fields in PLOVER. More generally, PLOVER takes the general purpose ``events'' of CAMEO (as well as the earlier WEIS, IDEA and COPDAB ontologies) and splits these into three components: generally ``$event-mode-context$'' corresponds to ``$what-how-why$.'' We anticipate at least four advantages to this
\begin{enumerate}
\item The three ``$what-how-why$''components are now distinct, whereas various CAMEO subcategories inconsistently used the $how$ and $why$ to distinguish between subcategories.
\item We are probably increasing the ability of classifiers---as distinct from parser/coders---to assign \texttt{mode} and \texttt{context} compared to their ability to assign subcategories.
\item In initial experiments, it appears that the  approach \textit{much} easier for humans to code than the hierarchical structure of CAMEO because a human coder can hold most of the relevant categories working memory (well, that and a few tables easily displayed on a screen)\footnote{PLOVER coding may also be easier because everything in the $event-mode-context$ coding uses words, not numerical codes, so coders will probably be using the parts of the brain (Broca's area) which are specialized for processing words. No known specialized cognitive facility exists for handling some 250 2-to-4-digit codes.}
\item Because the words used in differentiate \texttt{mode} and \texttt{context} are generally very basic, translations of the coding protocols into languages other than English is likely to be easier than translating the subcategory descriptions found in CAMEO. 
\end{enumerate}

While both \texttt{mode} and \texttt{context} will usually take a single value, in some instances multiple values will be appropriate and this is allowed (and preferable to generating multiple events from a single text). Both fields are optional, and unless an ``other'' category is explicitly specified---this has been provided in a couple of the event categories to provide compatibility with other coding systems---if no existing values seem appropriate, the field should be left null, though perhaps with some details provided in the \texttt{comment} field, particularly when the record is generated using human coding.

In general, verbal activities only have a \texttt{context} since their \texttt{mode} is just ``verbal.'' The exceptions are \plcat{CONSULT} where the \texttt{mode} indicates how the consultation was done, and \plcat{THREATEN} where the \texttt{mode} indicates what action is being threatened. 

Four special \texttt{context} categories are ``historical'', ``future'', ``hypothetical'', and ``negation": PLOVER assumes that the coding engine will be able to resolve these and put that information in the \texttt{context}. Negated events can be excluded from the final event dataset. Examples:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \textsc{historical}: ``During the decolonization struggle, Angolan forces..."
   \item \textsc{future}: ``Members of the G-7 will meet in Ottawa next month..."
   \item \textsc{hypothetical}: ``If Russian forces were to cross the border, that would represent a major..."
   \item \textsc{negation}: ``Thus far, fighting has not re-emerged in the tense region."	
   \end{itemize}
  
Theoretically, some event types can be represented as other event types plus a special context: \plcat{AGREE} could be  \plcat{SUPPORT} + future or \plcat{THREATEN} could be \plcat{ASSAULT} + hypothetical. In situations like these, the coder should always return the single event category, not a category+context.


We anticipate that in general---and consistent with earlier event coding schemes---it will be possible to code \texttt{mode} from the same sentence used to code the event, or possibly that sentence and one before it. \texttt{context}, in contrast, will often need to be coded at the paragraph- or document-level: this differs from earlier automated coding, though probably is similar to human-coded data such as COPDAB and BCOW where \texttt{context}-like fields were coded.

PLOVER, in contrast to CAMEO, makes recipient actors optional for some event types. One outstanding question is whether the source actor should also be optional for some event types. Some event types often leave the source actor implicit, for example, ``4 people were arrested/killed in a suicide bombing/detained/etc." These have no explicit, named source actor so they will not be coded by PLOVER. Similarly, many natural disasters do not fit neatly into an actor-centric approach to coding (``mudslides destroyed dozens of houses"). We could consider relaxing this requirement to increase our recall, but at the potential cost of more false positives and greater conceptual complexity.

\subsection{A note on CRIME}

A separate event category for crime has been added and removed several times as PLOVER was being drafted. While criminal activity is important to capture in event data \citep{osorio2015contagion, osorio2017supervised}, we have decided to not include a separate event category for it for several reasons:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Whether activity is criminal or not often depends on on the identity of the actor: actions undertaken by rebel groups may not fit within a definition of CRIME, while the same action taken by a drug cartel might. We have generally tried to avoid relying on the identities of actors in order to define events, due in part to the implementation of past coders, which did not use actor information to code event types. 
	\item Crime overlaps with other event categories, especially ASSAULT, which would make it difficult to train a CRIME classifier that did not pick up events that better belong in other categories.
\end{enumerate}


That said, PLOVER still includes mechanisms for crime-type events to be coded. Researchers who are interested in criminal behavior have two primary options for locating it in PLOVER events:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Identify events taken by criminal actors. As coders move away from hand-constructed dictionaries to resolve actors, many more groups will be coded. Researchers will be able to subset events to those undertaken by specific criminal groups (e.g. the Sinaloa Cartel) or by using the CRM actor code.
	\item Use the crime contexts. PLOVER includes context codes for different kinds of crime (see Table \ref{tab:context}). Researchers will be able to select events that have these contexts applied to them.
\end{enumerate}



\section{AGREE}

\textsf{VERBAL COOPERATION} \vspace{8pt}

Agree to, offer, promise, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to cooperate, includign promises to sign or ratify agreements.  All cooperative actions reported in future tense are also taken to imply intentions. 

\begin{comment}
pas 2018-01-06

As I'm going through a lot of GSRs, I'm beginning to wonder whether we should combine AGREE and SUPPORT: it's not really clear to me whether the boundary is between them. This would continue a consolidation of the various WEIS verbal categories -- e.g. AGREE/PROMISE, WARNING/THREAT -- that we initiated with CAMEO.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Potential ambiguities}

There's the potential for some events to fit both the definition of \plcat{AGREE} and \plcat{SUPPORT} + a ``future'' special context. For example, ``Russia and the United States \emph{will sign an agreement} limiting certain kinds of weapons...". When situations like this occur, the coder should always return the single event category that fits, rather than a category+special context.

\subsection{Requires recipient: No}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: None}

\section{CONSULT}

\textsf{VERBAL COOPERATION} \vspace{8pt}

All consultations and meetings: this includes visiting and hosting visits, as well as meeting at a neutral location, and consultation by phone or other media. Other useful keywords: ``Holding talks'' and ``discussions'', ``negotiations, bargaining, or discussions''. See the discussion in Section \ref{sec:recip} on the treatment of actors in \plcat{CONSULT} events.

\subsection{Requires recipient: No}

In \plcat{CONSULT} events where there is no clear distinction between whether an actor is hosting or visiting, all participants are coded as source actors. In events where one side is hosting and one is visiting, the visitor will always be coded as the source actor and the host will be the recipient.

\section{SUPPORT}

\textsf{VERBAL COOPERATION} \vspace{8pt}

Initiate, resume, improve, or expand diplomatic, non-material cooperation; express support for, commend, approve policy, action, or actor, or ratify, sign, or finalize an agreement or treaty. Use this code only for political, diplomatic, and non-material support, including recognition of newly independent states, new governments that might have come to power through unconventional means, and initiation of diplomatic ties with an entity for the first time. 

\plcat{SUPPORT} is distinct from the CAMEO \plcat{APPEAL} category, where the actor simply \textit{requested} support from the recipient: these events, like comments generally, are not coded in PLOVER.
 
\subsection{Requires recipient: No}

\subsection{Potential ambiguities}

In general, \plcat{SUPPORT} is a somewhat ambiguous term. It seems to imply a material event, but this category should only be used for verbal cooperation.

\begin{itemize}
\item Formal pardons and amnesties of arrested persons should be coded as \plcat{CONCEDE}; the actual release  or exchange of prisoners should be coded as \plcat{RETREAT}.

\item Expressions of regret or remorse for an action or situation should be coded as \plcat{CONCEDE}.

\item Promises to sign or ratify agreements and treaties are coded as \plcat{AGREE}

\item Military cooperation or defense should be coded as \plcat{COOPERATE} with a \txt{military} $context.$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: None}


\newpage

\section{CONCEDE}

\textsf{VERBAL COOPERATION} \vspace{8pt}


This covers verbal concessions which have no immediate material consequences, including promised of future concessions, including easing of administrative or legal restrictions on persons and organizations, remove curfews, suspending protests, declarations (but not implementations) of ceasefires and withdrawals from territory.

\plcat{CONCEDE}, like the verbal components CAMEO/WEIS predecessor \plcat{YIELD}, is inherently problem since many concessions deal with promises that certain things will \ti{not} happen, or will happen in the distant future (e.g. many policy changes). So, for example, the lifting of a curfew is, effectively, a promise that people will not be arrested for violating the curfew, which itself is not an event. We're treating such concessions as verbal rather than material even though sometimes they have material consequences, e.g. people coming out in the streets after a curfew is lifted. But only if they believe the government. As noted in Section \ref{sec:nothing}, PLOVER isn't really set up to deal with these levels of event dependence. 

\begin{comment}

pas 2016-10-20

I split CAMEO YIELD but and most of the old categories break out pretty easily but I'm still not quite sure the following belongs here

\item Yield by relinquishing political power, either via voluntary concessions or involuntary surrenders. Use this code when source surrenders power after being challenged through legitimate institutional channels (e.g. elections) or other coercive strategies (e.g. military coups). The target can either be the challenger(s) or the country as a whole.

\begin{itemize}
\item Initiate, resume, improve, or expand economic exchange or cooperation.

\item Military exchanges such as joint military games and maneuvers.

\item Cooperation on judicial matters, such as extraditions and war crimes.

\item Voluntary exchanges or sharing of intelligence and other significant information .

\end{itemize}

\noindent \plcat{COOPERATE} is distinguished from \plcat{AID} because the activity is generally understood to directly benefit both parties, whereas  \plcat{AID} is understood to primarily benefit only the recipient. 

\subsection{Requires recipient: Yes}

\newpage

\section{AID}

\textsf{MATERIAL COOPERATION} \vspace{8pt}

All provisions of providing material aid whose material benefits primarily accrue to the recipient. Examples include: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Monetary aid and financial guarantees, grants, gifts and credit.

\item Military and police assistance including arms and personnel.

\item Humanitarian aid such as emergency assistance.

\item Asylum, both to persons in its territories (territorial asylum) and diplomatic asylum on the premises of an embassy.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requires recipient: Yes}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: None. Use general contexts instead.}

\section{RETREAT}

\textsf{MATERIAL COOPERATION} \vspace{8pt}


\plcat{RETREAT} covers any events---not just military ``retreat'' from territory---which have an immediate (not simply promised) material consequences, such as the release of prisoners and hostages, repatriation of refugees, the return of  confiscated property, allowing the entry of observers, peacekeepers, or humanitarian workers, disarming, observing a ceasefire or otherwise ending active conflicts, and, of course, a military retreat from, or ceding, territory. \plcat{RETREAT} also covers resignations of government officials.

\newpage  

\section{DEMAND}

\textsf{VERBAL CONFLICT} \vspace{8pt}


All demands and orders. Demands are stronger or more forceful than a request or appeal---which is not coded in PLOVER---and potentially carry more serious repercussions, although not as much as threats. Coding will need to rely primarily on the language used by reporters to make this distinction.  All demands are verbal acts. 

Examples from the CAMEO manual include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Demand that recipient engages in some form of material or economic exchange or assistance.
\item Demand that recipient engages in or expands military relations or assistance.
\item Demand that recipient engages in or expands cooperation in judicial matters.
\item Demand that recipient exchanges intelligence or information.
\item Demand expansion of diplomatic ties or non-tangible support on particular policies.
\item Demands by refugees to be let into the territories of other countries (which should be coded as recipients) and asylum demands all fit here. These are not necessarily verbal acts; refugees could be actively seeking shelter or refuge in recipient countries or regions.
\item Demand that the recipient provides military protection or peacekeeping forces  for itself or on behalf of another party.
\item Demand for elections, changes in leadership or regime, or constitutional/institutional/policy change.
\item Demand provision or expansion of social, political, or other rights, as well as demands for provision of compensation for previously violated rights.
\item Require, demand major institutional, constitutional, or regime change.
\item Demands for fundamental changes in the political system (e.g. democratization) as well as more limited institutional changes (e.g. changing electoral law).
\item Demand that recipient relaxes administrative restrictions.
\item Demand that recipient stops political protest activities.
\item Demand that recipient releases persons (e.g. prisoners, hostages) or property.
\item Demand that recipient lifts or eases economic sanctions, boycott, or embargo.
\item Demand that recipient allow access to international actors, such as observers, humanitarian agencies, and peacekeeping forces.
\item Demand that recipient stops fighting or takes measures to ease military conflict or tension, for example ceasefires, military withdrawals, and demobilization.
\item Order party(ies) to meet, negotiate; this event form can be initiated by either the adversaries or other third parties.
\item Order parties to a conflict to reach a settlement, agreement, or resolution of conflict.

\subsection{Requires recipient: No}


\subsection{Potential ambiguities}

\begin{itemize}
\item This category only applies to verbal demands: demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded as \plcat{PROTEST}.
\item When one or more parties to a conflict call for ending the conflict, that is taken to be an expression of intent on the part of that source actor and is thus coded as \plcat{AGREE}.

\end{itemize}

%From Ben: i) Per page 2 of Phil's memo, the scores on INVESTIGATE and DISAPPROVE are each -2.0. This is probably fine. But part of me wonders whether INVESTIGATE should get a -2.1 or -2.5 in this case, since it is essentially the 'material conflict' version of the 'verbal conflict' DISAPPROVE. I suppose one could also make the case for just collapsing INVESTIGATE and DISAPPROVE into a single category in PLOVER, with separate modes distinguishing allegations from formal investigations. The drawback to collapsing them in PLOVER is that this would have implications for quadcounts of the resultant PLOVER events (Table 5.2 in the PLOVER manual), and for these quad counts' comparability to ICEWS/CAMEO quad-counts. So probably best to keep INVESTIGATE and DISAPPROVE separate.

\section{ACCUSE}

\textsf{VERBAL CONFLICT} \vspace{8pt}

Note: This section merges in the older DISAPPROVE and INVESTIGATE categories.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Express disapprovals, objections, and complaints; condemn, decry a policy or an action; criticize, defame, denigrate responsible parties.
	\item Accuse, allege, or charge, both judicially and informally
	\item Sue or bring to court
	\item All investigations, including those of historical cases. Examples include investigations of  criminal activity (theft, killing, etc) and corruption, human rights abuses, war crime, and violations of basic freedoms, military activities such as violations of ceasefire, seizures, and invasions.
\end{itemize}

Examples from the CAMEO manual include:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Allege, charge the recipient with, or blame for engaging in crime or corruption.
\item Allege, charge the recipient with, or blame for human rights violations, such as arbitrary detentions for prosecutions, torture, and slavery.
\item Allege, charge the recipient with, or blame for initiating hostilities or engaging in questionable or unjustifiable military actions such as violations of ceasefire, or with war crimes.
\item Allege, charge the recipient with, or blame for spying, espionage, or treason.
\item Written and institutionalized protests, appeals, and all petition drives and recalls. % Do we want the word protest here?
\item Sue, file civil or criminal lawsuit at domestic or international courts. Source must be the plaintiff or the state, and recipient must be the defendant.

\section{THREATEN}

\textsf{VERBAL CONFLICT} \vspace{8pt}

All threats, coercive or forceful warnings with serious potential repercussions. Threats are typically verbal acts. Examples from the CAMEO manual include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Threats to reduce or eliminate provision of assistance.

\item Threaten to impose sanctions, boycotts, or embargoes.

\item Threaten to reduce or formally sever ties. Non-force threats to declare independence, resign, withdraw diplomats, reduce or break diplomatic ties, etc.\ are all coded here.

\item Threaten to impose or expand non-force administrative restrictions and penalties not otherwise specified.

\item Threaten to impose or expand restrictions on fundamental freedoms, such as freedoms of speech, expression, and assembly, or threats to restrict rights and freedoms.

\item Threaten to mobilize or engage in actions of political dissent.

\item Threaten to break-up or withdraw from discussion, negotiation, or meeting.

\item Threaten to occupy, seize control of the whole or part of a territory.  This event form is typically a verbal act and is distinct from \plcat{ASSAULT}, which refers to military occupations that have been or are being carried out.
\item Threaten to use violence, including terrorist activities

\item Give a final warning, ultimate demand or order, the rejection of which carries the risk of some form of retaliation by the party issuing the ultimatum.

\section{SANCTION}

\textsf{MATERIAL CONFLICT} \vspace{8pt}

All reductions in normal, routine, or cooperative relations not otherwise specified. Note that this is not confined to formal ``sanctions''---\plcat{SANCTION} was just the best word we could find for WEIS and CAMEO's ``REDUCE RELATIONS''

Examples from the CAMEO manual include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Curtail, decrease, break, or terminate diplomatic exchange.
\item Reductions or terminations of aid not otherwise specified.
\item Decrease or terminate provision of economic, military or humanitarian aid.
\item Stop or restrict commercial or other material exchange as a form of protest or punishment.
\item Terminate discussions, negotiations. Use this event form to code failed negotiations and walk-outs, as well as other disruptions of planned negotiations. Note that the termination can be either unilateral or bi/multi-lateral.
\item Terminate mediation activities.
\item Terminate the presence of groups or organizations: this covers both expulsions by host authorities and withdrawals by guest groups or organizations, as well as diplomats are withdrawn or expelled. .   \item Terminate the deployment or presence of peacekeeping forces, inspectors or other observers.
\item Terminate the presence of aid agencies or other non-governmental organizations helping civilians.
\item  Impose embargo, boycott, or sanctions
\item  Find guilty or liable at a court of law. Source must be the court in question, which could be domestic or international, and recipient must be the defendant. This event form refers typically to rulings against non-individuals, where imprisonment is not an issue. When individuals are found guilty and are therefore detained, use \plcat{COERCE} instead.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requires recipient: Yes}

\subsection{Potential ambiguities}

\begin{itemize}
\item Expulsions or deportations of individuals---typically a legal matter---are coded as \plcat{COERCE} 
\item Withdrawal of hostile military forces constitutes a form of yielding and is thus coded as \plcat{YIELD}.
\item Cancellation of meetings are \plcat{REJECT} and therefore verbal conflict.

\section{MOBILIZE}

\textsf{MATERIAL CONFLICT} \vspace{8pt}


All military or police moves that fall short of the actual use of force. 

This category is different from \plcat{ASSAULT} and \plcat{FIGHT}, as they refer to uses of force, while military posturing falls short of actual use of force and is typically a demonstration of military capabilities and readiness. \plcat{MOBILIZE} is also distinct from \plcat{THREAT} in that the latter refers merely to threats, is typically verbal, and does not involve any activity that is undertaken to demonstrate military power. Source actors  are not necessarily militaries affiliated with states but any organized armed groups. Recipients are actors against whom the source mobilizes its military capabilities in a threatening manner if that is clear, but a group may mobilize with no specific recipient stated.

\subsection{Potential ambiguities}

Joint military operations are coded as \plcat{COOPERATE} but single-country exercises should be coded as \plcat{MOBILIZE}.

How these contexts are used in practice will depend on how a coder implements them. If they are applied using document-level classifiers, researchers/analysts could mis-interpret the meaning of contexts. For example, an \plcat{ASSAULT} event with an ``elections'' context does not necessarily imply electoral violence. It could be an article about, for instance, violence in Afghanistan in the context of an article on US election politics. Thus, the interpretation of ``context'' may depend on how it's implemented in practice.

\section{Numeric conflict/cooperation scores}

Researchers and analysts often want to represent events along a conflict/cooperation scale. In CAMEO, these scores were Goldstein scores that mapped specific CAMEO codes to a $-$10 to $+$10 scale (though in fact the most cooperative action had score of only $+$8.5. The ``PLOVER numeric scores'' given in Table \ref{tab:schrodtscores} provide numeric conflict/cooperation scores for PLOVER. They were created by taking a weighted average of the CAMEO/Goldstein scores for each PLOVER category, with the weights being the empirical frequency of the CAMEO event type in an 18 month sample of events. Two changes were made based on our knowledge of the categories: COERCE and MOBILIZE were flipped, so COERCE was increased in magnitude from -5.3 to -7.2 and MOBILIZE moved from -7.2 to -5.3.

\begin{table}[htp]

\chapter{Actor and Sector Codes}

CAMEO employed a hierarchical actor coding structure based on 3-character coding elements which allowed nearly unlimited complexity and, depending on the exact coding system, could be resolved down to the identity of individual groups or individuals. As with the event codes, typically only the first two or three of these elements were used. ICEWS modified this somewhat, while preserving most of the sub-state differentiations as ``sectors''---the terminology we've adopted here over the CAMEO/IDEA ``agents''---but also provided a very substantial amount of complexity at the sub-sector level.

As with the events, the PLOVER specification seeks to pare this down to the most commonly used actors and agent/sectors, while retaining the possibility of more specific information. In place of the pages of actor and agent specification found in the CAMEO manual, PLOVER has four rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The actor code---\texttt{source/recipient}---is either an ISO 3 letter country code or one of a small number of non-state codes such as IGO; see Table \ref{tab:nonstate} below.
\item The sector code is a 3-character primary code with one optional secondary code
\item Identifiers for individual persons or organizations are coded in the \texttt{Identifier} and/or \texttt{Text} fields. Ideally, the ID would take the form of a Wikidata ID and the text would be the canonical English-language name of the Wikidata entry. Including this information will greatly help researchers who want to (1) track a particular actor or person, (2) need to make fine-grained distinctions that are currently subsumed within a single code (USA MIL = Army + Navy + Air Force + ... and USA GOV = the president + the State Department + the attorney general of Oklahoma + the city of Cambridge + ...) and (2) researchers who would like to assign different sector codes using the raw information provided by Wikidata/Wikipedia (e.g. who might like to make a new sector category for right-wing populist parties and politicians.
\item The \texttt{Info} JSON object is used for additional information beyond what can be coded in the sector secondary modifier\fn{In other words, one item of information---typically it is religion, ethnicity, or position---can be coded in the tertiary code, but only one: this handles virtually all of the current use-cases we know of.} such as religion, ethnicity, official position, etc.
\end{enumerate}

An example actor block is below:

\begin{verbatim}
	{
	 "raw_text": "Steinmeier",
	 "entity_name": "Frank-Walter Steinmeier",
	 "wikidata_id": "Q76658",
	 "wiki_description": "Minister of Foreign Affairs",
	 "country_code": "DEU",
	 "sector_code": "GOV"
	 }
\end{verbatim}

While the process of generating this block will depend on the specific nature of the coder, in general, the coder will (1) identify a source actor or recipient in text, in this case, "Steinmeier". (2) Using the context of the article, resolve the actor mention to its Wikipedia page and ID and report the Wikipedia role or description. (3) Using the information on the page, determine that Frank-Walter Steinmeier was the German Minister of Foreign Affairs and thus DEUGOV.

%\begin{quote}
%\textbf{2-element sector codes?? You're going  to regret that, right?}

%Yeah, probably. The primary motivation for this is differentiating multiple sub-state militarized groups (REB) which in the current environment are typically distinguished by either religion (Central African Republic), ethnicity (Somalia, South Sudan, Myanmar) or a combination (Iraq, Syria). Allowing a second element in the sector codes allows one to do this without using the more elaborate \texttt{Info} object. But we're not allowing sector codes to handle something of the complexity of ``Iranian-backed Bosnian Serb militia.''\fn{Such a group existed in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s: we're guessing it was rather small.}
% Including the canonical Wikidata name/ID of the actor will hopefully reduce the need for some of this: two rebel groups in the same country with the same ethnic/religious identity can now be distinguished by canonical name as well as by actor code.
%\end{quote}

\section{Actor codes}

For nation-states and other entities for whom an ISO-3166 code\fn{\txt{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_3166-1\_alpha-3}} exists\fn{For example, dependencies such as the \AA land Islands}, use the alpha-3 code. Use the codes in Table \ref{tab:nonstate} for non-state actors:

%	\item UAF has been used inconsistently: is it un\emph{identified} or un\emph{aligned} armed forces? I've seen it both ways in practice. If the latter, it gets very close to to the PRM (paramilitary) code.
%	\item OPP: We need to clarify whether this category includes opposition parties as well as opposition groups/individuals. It's a bit weird to code the Labour Party as GBR OPP when it's not in power, giving it the same status as pre-2016 Aung San Suu Kyi or the Russia of the Future Party.
%	\item CVL vs. ELI: we should be clear when people fall under CVL and when they're ELI. Is a prominent lawyer in a country CVL or ELI?
%	\item BUS vs. MNC: how much do people care about distinguishing business from multinational corporations? Can we just use BUS for both?
%	\item I think we need a little more guidance on how to stack these codes. For example, does the Russian GRU get the code RUS GOV SPY? Or RUS MIL SPY? Or just RUS SPY, which is presumably what the SVR would get?

\subsection{Compound and Reciprocal Actors}\label{sec:recip}

Most CAMEO-based coders dealt with compound actors---``The United States and France accused Russia\ldots''---by generating multiple events: this example would generate two events of the form
\begin{verbatim}
	USA  RUS  112
	FRA  RUS  112
\end{verbatim}
This approach, however, gets very problematic in the not-uncommon situation where an alliance is involved and is expanded to all of its constituent members: a single reference to the G20 expands to at least twenty events, and a \textit{meeting} of the G20, generating reciprocal events, expands to 380 events, which is one of the reasons ``consult'' events are so frequent in CAMEO-coded data.

In PLOVER, compound actors generate a single source or recipient, but with multiple members: the source and recipient are a list of actors rather than a single actor. Depending on the application, a user might expand this to multiple events with single actor codes following the earlier conventions, but the initial coding uses the list.

PLOVER also uses actor lists to deal with reciprocal events. In CAMEO, a meeting ``President Obama met with Japanese Prime Minister Abe at the White House"" generated two events
\begin{verbatim}
	JAP  USA  042
	USA  JAP  043
\end{verbatim}
where 042 and 043 are the CAMEO codes for "visit" and "host" respectively.\footnote{This example optimistically assumes the coding system was clever enough to recognize the significance of the phrase ``at the White House.''} While the PLOVER \plcat{CONSULT} mode provides for a host/visit distinction, this is not required. In such instances, all of the actors are considered as the source and no recipient is included.

In \plcat{ASSAULT} events, reciprocal violence---as distinct from one-sided violence---is handled in a similar fashion, with both parties as \texttt{source} actors: this applies in any event where both sides are using force, even if one side ``started it''\footnote{An assessment often as not contested anyway.} One-sided violence, such as assassinations or police firing on demonstrators, will have the perpetrator as the \texttt{source} and the victims as \texttt{recipient}.



\chapter{Data Fields}

\textbf{This section is still under development and is not likely to be of interest to most readers.}

In keeping with OEDA's founding aversion to any efforts at creating ``one data set to rule them all,'' almost all of the fields listed below are optional: the objective of this part of the specification is mostly to provide a standard set of field names to simplify the merging and reuse of datasets. Despite the apparent complexity here, note that the only required field we have added to ``event data classic'' is the \texttt{id} identifier, so the simplest form of an event record would look like
\begin{verbatim}
{
	"id" : "PHOXv1-20160724-0042",
	"date" : 2016-07-24,
	"source" : [{"code":"USA"}],
	"recipient" : [{"code":"CAN"}],
	"event" : ["AGREE", "CONSULT"]
}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent For ease of parsing and use, we suggest formatting PLOVER in newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) format, with each event formatted as one valid JSON entry, each on a separate row.

Except in the small number of cases where a standard format is specified, the content of the field is left open, and in particular ``number'' should be interpreted as ``number or code'': for example instead of providing the number of individuals killed, a dataset might use a set of categories giving ranges. Similarly, categories such as \texttt{context} can take multiple values: typically your end users would probably be happiest if these were formatted using a JSON ``array'' structure---comma-delimited in square brackets---but this is not assumed. Responsibility for handling these details is left to the data provider and users. \emph{I think we should take a firmer stance on all of this, producing a fully built out ``PLOVER-base" with all of the fields we discuss above. Other researchers can then certainly make their own variants of PLOVER (PLOVER-ICEWS, PLOVER-ACE, PLOVER-Andy's dissertation, etc) as needed, making it clear how they differ from PLOVER-base.}

Providers should feel free to include named fields beyond those provided hence---hence the absence of any generic field names like \texttt{extra1}, \texttt{extra2} in the standard---but if you are coding or extracting information that corresponds to one of the existing fields, please use that name.

This format is designed to be sufficiently general that it should be useable as input to a coding system: note in particular
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{has\_event} can be set to False prior to full event coding 
% \item \color{red}{Open issue 20.02.29 PAS}: \color{black}If a data set is going to retain a record of the cases rejected, perhaps a separate \texttt{not\_coded} field, perhaps holding a list of reasons for this, would be useful.

\noindent \textbf{Notes:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The identifier should be unique within the data set; it is the responsibility of the user to reconcile identifiers across data sets
\item ISO 8601 allows a number of different formats for times depending on the level of detail. Formatting should be such that a string of the form \texttt{date + `T' + time} should yield an ISO-8601 datetime.
\item  \texttt{event}, \texttt{mode} and \texttt{context} fields can have multiple entries; they do not need to resolve to a single value, and in fact this is likely to occur fairly frequently in classifier-based systems which work with the general sense of a sentence, in contrast to dictionary-based systems which look for specific sets of words. Multiple event categories would be used in a single record if the source and recipient actors are the same; they would resolve to multiple records if the source and recipient actors are different, as might occur in a compound sentence.
\item  This can be used to create a common reference across multiple related events, demonstrations in multiple locations organized by the same group.
\item This is typically set to False when the record is part of a pre-processing pipeline
\item This slot will only be filled when the creator of the record has appropriate intellectual property rights for the text: this tends to be the exception rather than the rule
\end{enumerate}


\section{Adding to PLOVER: protest example}\label{sec:adding_to_plover}



A protest-specific coder could add more fields to the event record for things like the participant size (a numeric amount or size category), the number of people who were injured, the number of people arrested, etc. This section briefly outlines how PLOVER could be extended to code specific event types in greater detail.

For example, a protest-optimized coder could also include protest-specific contexts like the ones in Table \ref{tab:protestcontext}.

\noindent \textbf{Notes:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Geonames, alas, uses ISO-3166-alpha-2 rather than the more mnemonic alpha-3 codes used in most event data work. For purposes 
of compatibility, we're suggesting retaining this in the ``country code'' field but adding a ``cc3'' field (not found in geonames) for
alpha-3 codes.
%\item \color{red}{PTB: We have already had to resolve some of this in the geolocation work at UTD, so we may already have a cross-walk that deals with this over time.  Think for example of the Yugoslavia breakup case.} \color{blue}{PAS: \textit{So far} Yugoslavia is uniquely problematic, though anything but trivial. Probably wouldn't hurt to specify something for that as part of PLOVER---that has effectively been done in the CountryCodes file (I think) and/or the PETR dictionaries. Guessing we've going to get something similarly problematic with respect to an emerging Kurdistan as a state encompassing parts of both SYR and IRQ, and Russian-occupied Ukraine could also be problematic.}

\noindent \textbf{Notes:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For unconventional weapons, the  \texttt{mode} in the \plcat{FIGHT} record would be set to ``Unconventional.'' In PLOVER, mass expulsions, killings and ethnic cleansing (CAMEO 201, 202, and 203) are a pattern of events, not a single event.
\item Generally, everything at the 3- and 4-digit level should simply be reduced to the 2-digit cue category and converted accordingly. Depending on your specific application, you might want to make some exceptions to this---for example a CAMEO  ``015: Acknowledge or claim responsibility'' might be considered \plcat{AGREE} and a CAMEO ``016: Deny responsibility'' might be considered REJECT---but we are not making general recommendations on this. Except to suggest that for the benefit of those trying to replicate your work, you carefully document any such decisions.

	\section{Actor Coding Cheatsheet}

\noindent 2010
\bigskip

\begin {itemize}
\item Underscore, underscore, underscore.

\item Never use ``a'', ``an'', or ``the'' in the beginning of an entry in the actors dictionary.

\item When entering just a name (e.g. \texttt{KOFI\_ANNAN}) without a job title (specifying organization, ethnicity, etc.), always date restrict! The entry \texttt{U.N.\_SECRETARY\_GENERAL\_KOFI\_ANNAN} does not require a date restriction, because you can assume he is \texttt{[IGOUNO]} by definition.

\item Do not use only first or last names such as \texttt{ROBERTS} or \texttt{ABDULLAH} that can be confused with other actors. In 99\% of cases, you need to use the full name and/or attach the title (for example, \texttt{SAUDI\_KING\_ABDULLAH}).

\item Remember to include all information given.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
GOVERNMENT_OWNED_BUSINESS [~GOVBUS]
MILITARY_COURT [~MILJUD]
STATE_OWNED_NEWS [~GOVMED]
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\item Use your judgment on when one identity supersedes another.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
AMERICAN_U.N._OBSERVER [IGOUNO]
FIJIAN_PEACEKEEPING_SOLDIER [IGOPKO].
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\item DonÕt confuse ethnicity with territory. Be careful with [PAL] vs. [PSE], and [ARB] vs. [MEA].

\item DonÕt be fooled when the title is not in the code.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ARAB_ALLY_JORDAN [JOR]
ARAB_CAPITALS [MEA]
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\item Any political party should be opposition or government with date restrictions. This also goes for Labor and Communist parties (not \texttt{[~LAB]} OR \texttt{[CMN]}).

\item When entering nouns and adjectives, only add an ``s'' if necessary. For example, never add ``negotiations'', but rather ``negotiation'' so that you do not have add it again when the singular form comes up.

\item Never inject your own bias.

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
EGYPTIAN_FUNDAMENTALIST_GROUP  [EGYMOSRAD] ;*** 7/17/01
\end{verbatim}
This entry assumes that all fundamentalist groups in Egypt are also Islamic.
\end{quote}
\end {itemize}

	\section{Ten (or Eleven) Commandments on Verb Phrases}

\begin {enumerate}
\item There are some verbs that innately express intent such as plan, prepare, promise, pledge, vow etc. But most all others, like ``provide'' or ``sign'', need a \texttt{WILL}, \texttt{IS\_TO\_} etc. in order to code in the \texttt{[030]}'s to differentiate betweens events that have taken place and those that have not. Instead of individualized codes for each, use brackets to cover your bases:


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ACCEPT
- { WOULD | IS_TO_ | WILL } *  MEDIATION [039]
\end{verbatim} \texttt{(Express intent to mediate)}
\end{quote}

\item When there is a formal agreement between two actors that describes a specific form of cooperation, always be as specific as possible, instead of always coding it as \texttt{[057:057]}.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
SIGN
- % * MILITARY ACCORD  [062:062]
\end{verbatim}
It is most accurate to say the parties are engaging in military cooperation.
\end{quote}

\item Only use the code \texttt{[139] (give ultimatum)} if cannot you specify another type of threat:


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ATTEND
- WILL_NOT_* TALKS UNLESS +
\end{verbatim}
In this case, use \texttt{[134] (Threaten to halt negotiations)} instead of \texttt{[139]}.
\end{quote}

\item Codes such as \texttt{RECEIV} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{+ * SUPPORT FROM \$} produce miscodes because they can be so many different ones: \texttt{[070]}, \texttt{[051]}, etc. Add (the minimally needed number of) words to give such vague phrases context.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
RECEIV
- + * FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM $ [071]
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\item Especially with problematic verbs like strike, always be sure to include necessary contextual information.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
SAID WOULD * AGAINST +
\end{verbatim}
This could be \texttt{[138] (threaten with military force)} or \texttt{[133] (threaten with political dissent).}
Instead, make the code
\begin{verbatim}
SAID WORKERS WOULD GO_ON_* AGAINST + [133]
\end{verbatim}
to erase the ambiguity.
\end{quote}

\item Restoring diplomatic relations is coded as \texttt{[050:050] (Engage in diplomatic cooperation)}, but establishing diplomatic relations is coded as \texttt{[054:054] (Grant diplomatic recognition)}.

\item When Peacekeepers arrive and are received, it is a reciprocal event: \texttt{[074:0861]}.

\item Use \texttt{[175] (Use tactics of violent repression)}, instead of \texttt{[173] (Impose curfew)}, for events where protesters/demonstrators/etc. are arrested, as we are capturing the fact that the government is using repression to restore order.

\item Adding nouns as verbs gets messy. Try to avoid this at all cost.

\item When in doubt, consult the CAMEO or TABARI codebook!

\item Whenever sensible, file a verb pattern under the \emph{first} verb to appear in the pattern. The first verb in a pattern is almost always the conjugated verb.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ATTACK
- PROMIS TO_*
PROMIS
- * TO_ATTACK
\end{verbatim}
These two verb patterns are essentially identical---there's no reason to have both. However, the second is preferable, because it will be read first in a sentence. Hence, if we have the sentence ``\texttt{Gondor promised to attack Mordor with tanks}'', and the verb pattern
\begin{verbatim}
PROMIS
- * TANKS [1384]
\end{verbatim}
the second verb pattern will overwrite the third, but the first pattern will not.
\end{quote}

\end {enumerate}
